        <p>Our most popular banana bread is moist, delicious, and absolutely packed with banana flavor.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Flour: All-purpose flour gives the banana bread structure.</li>
                <li>Baking soda: Baking soda acts as a leavener, which means it helps the banana bread rise.</li>
                <li>Salt: A pinch of salt enhances the overall flavor, but it won't make the loaf taste salty.\</li>
                <li>A stick of butter lends richness, moisture, and irresistible flavor.</li>
                <li>Brown sugar: Brown sugar sweetens things up and adds a hint of warmth.</li>
                <li>Eggs: Eggs act as a binding agent, which means they hold the batter together.</li>
                <li>Bananas: Of course, you'll need bananas! Choose overripe bananas.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
